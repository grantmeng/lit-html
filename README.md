# lit-html  
Simple lit-html example  
lit-html lets you write HTML templates in JavaScript, then efficiently render and re-render those templates together with data to create and update DOM.  

lit-html is extremely fast. It uses fast platform features like HTML <template> elements with native cloning.
Unlike VDOM libraries, lit-html only ever updates the parts of templates that actually change - it doesn't re-render the entire view.  

# installation
